    <h1>So what are the benefit of using GitHub?</h1>
    <ol class="blog">
        <li><h3>It makes it easy to contribute to your open-source projects</h3></li>
        <p>To be honest, nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to manage its project. Using GitHub is free if your project is open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more in-depth documentation and get feedback about your project. If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make your changes and then send them a pull request using the GitHub web interface</p>

        <li><h3>Documentation</h3></li>
        <p>By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for nearly any topic related to git that you can think of</p>
        
       
        <li><h3>Showcase your work</h3></li>
        <p>Are you a developer and wish to attract recruiters? GitHub is the best tool you can rely on for this. Today, when searching for recruits for their project, most companies look into GitHub profiles. If your profile is available, you will have a higher chance of being recruited even if you are not from a great university or college.</p>
